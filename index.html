                        <p> Hi there! I'm Ben, a graduate from the Geospatial Data Analytics program at the Centre of
                            Geographic Sciences in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia. This is a portfolio page I have setup
                            through GitHub Pages, wherein I will showcase some of the skills I developed over the
                            past school term.
                        </p>
                        <p> I began my career a while ago in advertising and media planning. The first code I ever wrote
                            was an Excel macro that helped me save time while inputting data from television commercial
                            schedules. I kept looking for other ways to improve or automate technical processes to make
                            my job easier, and along the way learned to cobble together 'spaghetti' code in a handful of
                            different languages.</p>

                        <p>My experience at COGS was the first actual schooling I ever received in programming, and I
                            was very happy with the experience. The thing I valued the most was that my instructors took
                            care to contextualize new concepts and tools rather than just show us how to use them. For
                            example, were were introduced to the Open Geospatial Constortium whose standards enable some
                            of the most commonly spatial data formats like KMLs, GeoTiffs, and Geopackages. I was also
                            happy to learn about things like style guidelines and how to implement test cases -- skills
                            that are essential to code well with others, which is something I had never really needed to
                            do
                            before.
                        </p>

                        <p>Of course I learned more at COGS than just how to use Python. Earlier classes in geodesy,
                            remote
                            sensing, database management and the use of GIS software provided foundational knowledge
                            that...
                            Spatial analysis, modelling, machine learning & neural networks.
                            .</p>

                        <p>How it fits career goals, new job, climate change, etc. </p>
