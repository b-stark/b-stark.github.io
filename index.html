                        <p> Hi there! I'm Ben, a graduate from the Geospatial Data Analytics (GDA) program at the Centre
                            of Geographic Sciences (COGS) in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia. This is a portfolio page I have
                            setup through GitHub Pages, wherein I will showcase some of the skills I developed over the
                            past school term.
                        </p>
                        <p> I began my career a while ago in advertising and media planning. The first code I ever wrote
                            was an Excel macro that helped me save time while inputting data from television commercial
                            schedules. I kept looking for other ways to improve or automate technical processes to make
                            my job easier, and along the way learned to cobble together 'spaghetti' code in a handful of
                            different languages.</p>

                        <p>My experience at COGS was the first actual schooling I ever received in programming, and I
                            was very happy with the experience. The thing I valued the most was that my instructors took
                            care to contextualize new concepts and tools rather than just show us how to use them. For
                            example, were introduced to the Open Geospatial Consortium whose standards have been
                            used to implement many of the
                            most common spatial data formats like KMLs, GeoTiffs, and Geopackages. We also learned about
                            things like style guidelines and how to implement test cases -- skills
                            that are essential to code well with others, which I may never have developed on my own.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the GDA program we were also encouraged to adapt our projects towards topics that
                            interested us. As someone trying to transition my career towards environmental conservation
                            and ecological restoration, this gave me the opportunity to work with data sources used by
                            professionals in these fields. Being able to speak about relevant work I did as a student
                            helped me to secure my first employment contract in land research, which I would have been
                            able to do without my time at COGS.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        With a small team, I developed a location suitability model for new forestry operations in
                        Saskatchewan. We used publicly available data to create sub-models for individual criteria
                        like proximity to infrastructure and the presence of environmentally protected areas. The output
                        of these models were scaled, combined, and weighted to produce an overall suitability raster
                        that
                        we used to make specific location recommendations.
                        We used ArcGIS Pro's Model Builder tool, as well as the Suitability workflow from its Spatial
                        Analyst extension to execute these steps.
